# Steganography-in-Python
Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file(here, I used png files) in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination(encoded.png).

*Setup*  

`pip install numpy`  

`pip install pillow`

*Usage*  

Go to the directory where your to-be-encoded file exists and run the python code!
